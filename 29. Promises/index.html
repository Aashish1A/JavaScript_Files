    <h2>What are Promises in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
      A Promise in JavaScript represents a value that may be available now,
      later, or never. It's used to handle asynchronous operations like API
      calls, file reading, timers, etc. Promises help avoid callback hell,
      making the code cleaner and easier to follow.
    </p>

    <strong>States of a Promise</strong>
    <ol>
      A Promise has three states:
      <li>Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
      <li>Fulfilled: The operation was completed successfully.</li>
      <li>Rejected: The operation failed.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Structure of a Promise</strong>
    <ol>
      A Promise is created using the new Promise() constructor and takes a
      function with two parameters:
      <li>resolve: Call this when the operation completes successfully.</li>
      <li>reject: Call this when the operation fails.</li>
    </ol>
